# ⚙️ Installing VMware Workstation (Windows)

## 🧩 Step 1: Download the Installer

Before creating a virtual machine, you’ll first need to **download and install VMware Workstation Pro** — one of the most popular tools for running virtual machines on Windows.

You can get the installer from one of these sources:

- 🔗 [Official VMware Website](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion)  
  Recommended for the **latest and official** version.
- 🗂️ [Alternative Mirror (Soft98)](https://soft98.ir/os/virtual-machine/1232-vmware-workstation.html)  
  Use this if the official link doesn’t work in your region.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Make sure to download the **Windows version (.exe)** of VMware Workstation.

## 🧭 Step 2: Verify and Prepare

After downloading:

1. Check that the file name ends with `.exe` (for example: `VMware-workstation-full-17.x.x.exe`).
2. If you downloaded a `.rar` file (from Soft98), extract it first using WinRAR or 7-Zip.
3. Close all unnecessary programs before starting the installation.
4. Ensure you have at least **5 GB of free disk space** available.

## ⚙️ Step 3: Run the Installer

1. Double-click the `.exe` file to start the installation wizard.
2. If prompted by Windows, click **Yes** to allow the installer to make changes.
3. Click **Next** to continue.
