# 🔵 Why Debian?

## 🎓 Why is it used in this course?

Debian is one of the **oldest and most stable** Linux distributions, which makes it a great choice for academic and system-related courses.

It’s used in this course because:

- 🧱 **It’s the foundation of many other Linux distros** (including Ubuntu)
- 🧩 **It teaches students “pure Linux” concepts** with fewer automatic helpers
- 🧠 **Perfect for learning system-level structure and package management**
- ⚙️ **Highly stable and consistent**, ideal for lab environments
- 🔐 **Completely open-source**, maintained by the community

> 🎯 **In short:** Debian helps students understand how Linux works _under the hood_ — with less abstraction and more control.
