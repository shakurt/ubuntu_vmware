# 🐧 Installing Ubuntu on VMware

This page follows the exact sequence provided. Each step is written for **Windows + VMware Workstation** and is intended to be used as a guide during the lab.

---

## Step 1 — Download the Ubuntu ISO

- Visit the official Ubuntu Desktop download page:  
  🔗 https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop
- Choose the **LTS (Long Term Support)** desktop release (recommended for labs).
- Download the `.iso` file (for example: `ubuntu-24.04-desktop-amd64.iso`).

> **Tip:** Keep the downloaded `.iso` in an easy-to-find folder (e.g., `Downloads\isos\`) so you can browse to it during VM creation.

---

## Step 2 — Create a New Virtual Machine

1. Open **VMware Workstation Pro**.
2. From the menu, select **File → New Virtual Machine**.
3. Choose **Typical (recommended)** and click **Next**.
   - (This option uses the guided wizard and is the fastest way for typical lab setups.)

## Step 3 — Select the Installer ISO and Continue

1. On the _Installer Options_ screen choose **Installer disc image file (iso)**.
2. Click **Browse…** and select the Ubuntu `.iso` you downloaded in Step 1.
3. VMware may detect the guest OS (e.g., “Ubuntu 24.04”). Confirm the detected OS and click **Next**.

> **Note:** VMware may show an **"Easy Install" / "Personalize Linux"** step after selecting the ISO — this is optional and related to Step 5 below.

## Step 4 — (If prompted) Enter User Info — Full name / Username / Password

- If VMware shows fields for **Full name**, **Username**, and **Password** at this point, you can fill them to allow VMware to automate parts of the installation.
  - Example values:
    - Full name: `Student Name`
    - Username: `student`
    - Password: `your_password_here`

## Step 5 — Choose VM Name and Storage Location

1. Set a **Name** for your virtual machine (e.g., `Ubuntu-Lab`).
2. Choose a **location** on your host disk where VM files will be stored.
   - Recommendation: use your main internal drive (SSD if available) for better performance.
3. Click **Next**.

> **Tip:** Keep the VM path short and on a drive with enough free space (e.g., `C:\VMs\Ubuntu-Lab\`).

## Step 6 — Virtual Disk Size and File Options

1. Set the **Maximum disk size** (suggested: **20 GB** or more).
2. Choose whether to **Store virtual disk as a single file** or **Split virtual disk into multiple files**.
3. Click **Next**.

**Recommended settings for this lab:**

- Disk size: `20 GB`
- Store as: **single file** (unless you need portability to FAT32/external drives)

## Step 7 — Finalize and Hardware Customization (optional)

1. Click **Customize Hardware...** if you want to adjust resources before finishing:
   - **Memory (RAM):** set to at least **2048 MB (2 GB)**; **4096 MB (4 GB)** recommended if your host has enough RAM.
   - **Processors:** set to **1 or 2** virtual cores depending on host availability.
   - **Network Adapter:** choose **NAT** (recommended for easy internet access) or **Bridged** (if you need VM on the same LAN as host).
   - **Display / Graphics:** enable 3D acceleration if you need better GUI performance (optional).
2. Click **Close** when done customizing.

## Step 8 — Power On and Finish

1. Click **Finish** in the New Virtual Machine wizard to create the VM.
2. Select the new VM and click **Power on this virtual machine**.
3. If you used VMware’s Easy Install and provided user info, the installation will proceed automatically.
   - Otherwise, the Ubuntu installer will boot from the ISO and you will go through the standard on-screen installation steps (language, keyboard, install type, user info, timezone, etc.).
4. After the installer completes, choose **Restart Now** when prompted. If the VM still has the ISO mounted, make sure to eject it (VMware usually handles this).
