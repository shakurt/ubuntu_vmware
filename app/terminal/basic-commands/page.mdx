# ⌨️ Basic Terminal Commands

## 🚀 Why learn terminal commands?

The terminal (CLI) is a compact and powerful interface for controlling a Linux system.  
Knowing a core set of commands lets you navigate the filesystem, inspect files, manage packages and services, debug problems, automate tasks, and work on remote machines — all efficiently and reproducibly.

> ⚠️ **Safety note:** Many commands (especially those that use `sudo` or `rm`) can change or delete data. Always double-check a command before running it on important systems.
